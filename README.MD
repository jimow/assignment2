#Assignment 2


The assignment is testing on all the frontend technologies. 
It seems to be easy from the look but has a lot of underlying test that is hard to understand.

I believe i did my **Level** best and *hope* to pass.
As indicated in the README file the following is what the assignment is testing.
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. JQUERY
5. Markdown
